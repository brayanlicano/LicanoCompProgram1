		<h2>About This Site</h2>
		<p>Over the past of two years being in CNM and learning about different
		coding languages. I was eager to study more about computer, since I was
		younger I was fascinated over how people can create games with code.
		Throughout my time in CNM, I love learning new coding languages.
		The toughest one is C++ and the easiest are Python and C#. Some of the programs
		that I made are examples of my work and showing my skills 
		in coding. </p>
